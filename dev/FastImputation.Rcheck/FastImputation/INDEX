BoundNormalizedVariable
                        Take a normalized variable and transform it
                        back to a bounded variable.
CovarianceWithMissing   Estimate covariance when data is missing
FItest                  Fraud Imputation Test Data
FItrain                 Fraud Training Data
FItrue                  Fraud "True" Data
FastImputation          Use the pattern learned from the training data
                        to impute (fill in good guesses for) missing
                        values.
LimitToSet              Coerce numeric values into a given set.
NormalizeBoundedVariable
                        Take a variable bounded above/below/both and
                        return an unbounded (normalized) variable.
TrainFastImputation     Learn from the training data so that later you
                        can fill in missing data
UnfactorColumns         Convert columns of a dataframe from factors to
                        character or numeric.
