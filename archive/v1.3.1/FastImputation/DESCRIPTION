Description: TrainFastImputation() uses training data to describe a
    multivariate normal distribution that the data approximates or
    can be transformed into approximating and stores this information
    as an object of class 'FastImputationPatterns'. FastImputation()
    function uses this 'FastImputationPatterns' object to impute (make
    a good guess at) missing data in a single line or a whole data frame
    of data.  This approximates the process used by Amelia
    [http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia/] but is much faster when
    filling in values for a single line of data.
